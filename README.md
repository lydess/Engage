# Engage
An application designed to onboard students faster and with a greater student experience then any RTO has been able to before

This app was my first major iOS dev project and ive kept it preserved in its original state (minus capatibility and breaking bug fixes) to act as my 
humble starting point in my career as an IOS dev.

The apps intention was to provide users with quick access to our course offerings, services, campus information and calenders for upcoming events. 
the secondary key feature was to allow for management of thier application from within the app themself, upon further consideration by my previous employer
i would set to work on integrating the front end app interface with our salesforce backend which provided the backend services for our enrollment pipeline.
